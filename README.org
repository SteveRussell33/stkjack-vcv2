This plugin aims to bring first class support for the JACK Audio
Connection Kit to VCV Rack.

This is a port of [[https://github.com/Skrylar][Skrylar]]'s JACK Audio to VCV Rack 2 with some added UX enhancements

* Known Issues
- Currently we create new ports instead of renaming them, as I rename everything first it's not a huge issue for me [[https://github.com/simotek/stjack-vcv2/issues/1]]
- Currently sometimes Rack crashes on close [[https://github.com/simotek/stjack-vcv2/issues/3]]

* Modules
** JackAndRack

 - There are four input and four output ports.
 - Output ports are marked with an off-color accent.
 - Each port may be named.

*** Four ports is not enough for me!
You have some options:

 1) Just add another =JackAndRack=. Seriously.
 2) Add one of the special 8 inbound or outbound modules.

JACK modules are designed to cooperate with one another. They will
feed audio to JACK or to Rack and only one of them will block Rack
while waiting for audio to be processed. You can consult the power
meter for proof.

** RackJack8
This is the same as a =JackAndRack= excepting all ports output to JACK.

** JackRack8
This is the same as a =JackAndRack= excepting all ports output to Rack.

* JACK Quirks

** Port names

*** 0.6.7
Port names have =-in= or =-out= suffixes added in the background. This
matches how applications usually work in the JACK ecosystem. It also
makes it possible to run Rack effects where both input and output
channels are named "reverb."

Input ports must have unique names across all inputs in a Rack
instance. All output ports must have unique names across all outputs
in a Rack instance.

This is a compatibility breaking change.

*** 0.6.6
All port names had to be unique across an entire Rack instance. Names
appeared exactly in JACK as they appeared in Rack.

** TODO Latency information
We do not currently calculate and report processing delay between a
signal entering Rack and exiting it. This means none of the delay
compensation logic works and you may end up with desyncs if running
more than one Rack instance or certain DAWs.

The issue is known and some attempt to fix this issue is scheduled.

* Compatibility

** Patched Rack's with JACK in RtAudio
Some users are running versions of Rack which contain patched RtAudio
libraries. These patches allow you to use JACK with the native =Audio=
modules.

Experience has shown that while this works enough to get audio to and
from Rack, it does not integrate well with the JACK ecosystem. I do
not support these special builds.

** Audio and rcm's Audio 16
ALSA, JACK and Pulse Audio tend to compete for exclusive access to the
sound card. Having an =Audio= module from =Core=, or an =Audio 16=
from =rcm= *will* result in issues.

These issues have mostly been reported as:

 1) A crash when exiting Rack,
 2) Rack crashing when trying to delete the =Audio= or =Audio 16=.

Some workarounds are known:

 1) Delete the offending models from patches,
 2) Leave them be (leave the =Audio= modules blank so they read "ALSA"
    but do not show a device such as =default-8=.

** Systems without a JACK server
Special support has been added to address:

 1) Running on machines with JACK, but the server is turned off.
 2) Running on machines where no JACK server is even installed.

In both cases the modules will simply do nothing. You may still name
ports and hook them up, and those will work if loaded in to a Rack
instance with a functioning JACK server.

* Licenses and Credits

** Graphics
The panel graphics in the res directory is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. You may not create modified adaptations of these graphics.

** StJACK
This plugin is made available under GPL3.

Previous versions were available under the BSD license. As Rack itself is no longer available under those terms, and we incorporate code from that project, this is no longer the case.

** JACK
A copy of the JACK client headers are included under =src/jack=, which
are made available to us under the LGPL license.

We have included them because it primarily simplifies compiling the
plugin on Windows (MinGW2) targets.
