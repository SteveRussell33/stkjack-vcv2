	* Why we are forking the Skrylar VCVRACK Module for JACK Audio Sound Server ?!
	
	* I am an old vcv rack user who was happy to use the skrylar plugin.
	  Only this plugin allowed me to make VCVRACK work under linux with the JACK sound server without Xruns
	  
	  The audio modules present in VCV rack based on RTaudio do not allow me to fully enjoy the software
	  I noticed a deterioration (cpu) in the use of vcvrack  before the switch to version 2 of the software
	  (tested with debian, archlinux, gentoo)
	  
	  The fork was made on my twitch channel live, thanks to the help of friends present in the chat
	  (Wako, acidKevin, seg_fote, vozgot, Jaynothin..)
	  
	  We have debug and strace Rack2, we have noticed that the CPU consumption is abnormally high
	  
	  We updated the Skrylar plugin in a dirty way to satisfy and pass the necessary steps for compilation and check if we can enjoy like in the past
